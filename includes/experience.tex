    Progressed from IC3 to IC6, advancing from being an IC3 on a Tier 1 with infrastructure-wide support responsibilities to
    leading critical datacenter automation initiatives in the bare metal provisoining space.
    Lately I have spearheaded an effor to transform the way
    we manage the Operating System for Meta's custom network switch infrastructure
    \href{https://engineering.fb.com/2015/03/10/data-center-engineering/facebook-open-switching-system-fboss-and-wedge-in-the-open/}{(FBOSS)},
    focusing on scalability, reliability, ownership and time to provision improvements.

  {Site Reliability Engineer (SRO team)}
  {
    March 2011 \newline April 2014
  }
  {
    I commenced my tenure at Facebook in 2011 as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) within the Site Reliability Operations (SRO) team. The SRO team operated on a follow-the-sun model, with a counterpart team in Palo Alto, ensuring round-the-clock reliability of Facebook's infrastructure. This role provided me with extensive exposure to internal technologies and systems, and honed my skills in managing large-scale systems and handling incidents and disasters. Being based in Dublin allowed me to work during relatively quiet, incident-free hours, which enabled me to concentrate on automation and tooling development.

    \begin{cvitems}
      \item {Contributed to the development of internal tooling like \href{https://engineering.fb.com/2011/09/15/data-center-engineering/making-facebook-self-healing/}{FBAR}, Facebook Auto Remediation, HostChangeLog, etc}
      \item {Performed emergency hotfixing and pushing of the www application}
      \item {Performed cluster maintenances: kernel updates, OS updates, host reprovisioning, and others}
      \item {Troubleshooted broken hardware and software issues}
      \item {Contributed migrating fleet from \texttt{cfengine2} to \texttt{chef}}
      \item {Architected and implemented Facebook's initial \texttt{netconsole} monitoring system for kernel-level diagnostics.
                  The solution leveraged Linux netconsole module to capture kernel printk messages via UDP/syslog, enabling critical
                  debugging capabilities when disk logging was unavailable. Designed and deployed a scalable architecture using
                  cluster-based rsyslog daemons integrated with \texttt{scribe} infrastructure. This foundational work later evolved
                  into \href{https://github.com/facebook/netconsd}{netconsd}, now maintained by the Kernel Platform Engineering team.}

  {Production Engineer (Teams: ClusterOps -> ClusterInfra -> Host Provisioning Engineering -> DC Bootstrap)}
  {April 2014 \newline 2022}
  {
    Following the successful automation of the SRO team's core responsibilities, the team was strategically dissolved and
    members were presented with opportunities to transition into new specialized focus areas.
    While several colleagues moved to product teams, I chose to remain in infrastructure by joining the ClusterOps team.
    This team managed essential infrastructure services including DNS, LDAP, NTP, DHCP, TFTP, and bare metal provisioning systems.
    During this period, I achieved several significant technical milestones:
    \vspace{2mm}
    \begin{cvitems}
      \item {\textbf{DHCP Infrastructure Modernization}: Led the complete redesign of Meta's DHCP infrastructure,
                  implementing ISC KEA with custom C++ hooks for internal system integration. This initiative
                  significantly improved reliability and scalability. Presented the architecture at \href{https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon15europe/program/presentation/failla}{SRECON EMEA 2015}
                  and was featured in \href{https://www.isc.org/blogs/how-facebook-is-using-kea-in-the-datacenter/}{the ISC's blog.}}
      \item {\textbf{IPv6-only Initiative}: Collaborated on a critical infrastructure project to transition
                  data centers to IPv6-only addressing, addressing RFC 1918 address space constraints. Led the
                  adaptation of the PXEboot stack and OS installation systems to support IPv6-only environments, contributing
                  to Meta's pioneering IPv6 adoption \href{https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/deploy360/2014/case-study-facebook-moving-to-an-ipv6-only-internal-network/}{and praised by the Internet Society.}}
      \item {\textbf{More DHCP infrastructure improvements}: Architected and implemented \texttt{dhcplb}, a high-performance
                  DHCP load balancer in Go. The project evolved from a hackathon prototype to a production-grade
                  solution, featuring IPv6 support and sophisticated load balancing algorithms. The initiative spawned
                  an industry-adopted open-source DHCP library and later expanded to include server-side functionality,
                  becoming a cornerstone of Meta's network infrastructure.}
      \item {Spearheaded the modernization of the PXEboot infrastructure, leading a complete rewrite from Python
                  to Go to enhance performance and reliability.}
      \item {Led the team in developing of a custom OS installation solution, replacing traditional RedHat
                  anaconda/kickstart systems with an optimized, more highly integrated with Facebook's infra, purpose-built installer utilizing custom bootloader, ramdisk and an initrd based on \href{https://github.com/u-root/u-root}{u-root}.}
    \end{cvitems}

  {Production Engineer (Network OS team)}
  {2022 \newline Present}
  {
    In 2022 I convinced leadership to start a new team to focus on redesigning the Operating System for Meta's custom network switch infrastructure.
    \begin{cvitems}
      \item {The design took a different approach from the traditional way of managing operating systems at Meta where a vanilla OS is installed and then configured with puppet/chef/ansible. This was taking too much time and was not reliable enough.}
      \item{The new approach consistent in building immutable images that are then deployed to the switches. The images are built with all the necessary configuration and software pre-installed. This brought down provisioning time from hours to ~15 minutes.}
